# Web Development Enrichment Week

Students will learn what the basic languages of the internet are (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), what they do, and how to use them.

Built as a remotely-delivered one-week series of lessons for 8th graders.


## Day 1

### Objectives
* Students will know what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are, and how they work together to build a website.
* Students will know the purpose of HTML. Students will be able to define and give examples of HTML tags, attributes, and elements.
* Students will be able to open the Inspector and navigate to the Elements tab in Chrome.

### Methods
Students will view a video, respond to comprehension questions, and find examples of HTML elements and attributes 'in the wild.'

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will set expectations for work to complete, confirm that students have received all materials, and demonstrate using the Inspector in a browser.

Teacher will set expectations for communication, including when and how to contact the teacher, and when work is due.

#### Part II: Individual
Students will watch this video: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript Explained] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)

Students will answer the following comprehension questions:
* What do the letters HTML stand for?
* What does HTML do on a website?
* What does CSS stand for?
* What does CSS do on a website?

Students will complete the worksheet for Lesson 1, including activities using the inspector on the course site. Questions & tasks on the worksheet include:
* Opening the inspector
* Identifying HTML tags, attributes, and elements
* Demonstrating mastery of HTML vocab by answering questions such as: "Which tag has a class attribute of 'app'?" and "What tag is used in the element that contains the image of Ms. Lord?"


## Day 2

### Objectives
* Students will understand the difference between id and class attributes in HTML.
* Students will know the purpose of CSS. Students will be able to define and give examples of CSS selectors and declarations.
* Students will be able to write CSS selectors that target HTML elements by tag name, id, and class

### Methods
With the teacher, students will explore CSS declarations in the "Styles" section of the "Elements" tab in the Inspector. Students will view a video about how CSS works, and write their own CSS selectors and rules.

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will review how to open Inspector and Navigate through HTML elements in "Elements" tab. Teacher will check that students understand the parts of an HTML element: The tag name, the attributes and their values, and the element itself.

Teacher will show how to find CSS rules for a selected HTML element in the "Styles" section of the "Elements" tab in the Inspector. Teacher will use existing CSS rules to explain the three types of CSS selector:

1. Tag selector
2. Class selector
3. ID selector

Teacher will briefly touch on the idea of specificity.

Teacher will use the following selectors, built into the class site, to demonstrate how to write CSS rulesets (selector, property, and value) in the "Styles" section:

Selectors on Mr. OD:
* ID's: shirt, pants
* Classes: shoe, eye--mr-od

Selectors on Figgy:
* ID: collar
* Class: eye--figgy

Selectors on both:
* Class: eye

Teacher will encourage students to try a few rules on their own and share their screens with the class to view results.

Teacher will end with a reminder to complete the entire worksheet independently, and to reach out with questions.

#### Part II: Individual
Students will watch this video, which recaps the selector rules discussed in group time: [CSS Selectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N97h59hr4pc)

Students will then complete the worksheet for the day, which asks them to combine their HTML and CSS knowledge to answer questions about an example page, and to write CSS rules that would change specified visual elements of the class page.


## Day 3

### Objectives
* Students will understand what JavaScript is, and the role it plays in modern web applications
* Students will be able to write working JavaScript code in the console of their web browser

### Methods
Students will read an article and follow along with the suggested activities in their browser console to learn the basics. Then, students will apply these skills on the course site as instructed in today's worksheet.

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will recap content from days 1 & 2:
* What is an HTML element, and what are its pieces (tag name, attributes, content)?
* What is a CSS ruleset, and what are its pieces (selector, property, value)?
* How do we target HTML elements using CSS tag, id, and class selectors?

Teacher will introduce what we're learning today: What is JavaScript, and how to write JavaScript in the console.

Teacher will model article and worksheet completion for students.

#### Part II: Individual
Students will watch this video, with a brief description of what JavaScript is and what it does: [What is JavaScript?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSWppEa2Zac)

Students will read and perform the exercises described in the first four sections of this article: [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/). Students will complete the sections entitled "The Basics", "Strings", "Values and Variables", and "Functions".

Students will answer the following comprehension questions about the video and article:
* Which of these is/are a programming language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript?
* Where does JavaScript code run: On a server, on your computer, or in the internet?
* What is a String?
* What is a Variable?
* What is a Function?

Students will complete worksheet activities which involve using the console to write and test JavaScript, and copying their successful code into their answer document. Activities will include:
* Performing basic math operations
* Assigning the result of a math operation to a variable
* Using JavaScript's toUpperCase function on a string
* Concatenating strings
* Assigning the result of string concatenation and toUpperCase to a variable


## Day 4

### Objectives
* Students will be able to select and modify an HTML element using JavaScript in the console

### Methods
Students will watch a video and write code in the console

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will give feedback on student progress so far, in general terms.

Teacher will recap what we learned about HTML, CSS selectors, and writing JavaScript in the console. The progress so far is that we can identify attributes in HTML elements, write CSS selectors targeting those elements by attribute (ID or class), and use those selectors in JavaScript to store (a reference to) the element in a variable, and use that variable to modify things about the element!

Teacher will remind student of worksheet procedures and due date, encourage students to stay in Google Meet until their work is done.

#### Part II: Individual

Students will watch this video: [Enrichment - USB - Lesson 4 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lZO3PVkits)

The video is mostly a review, but also shows how to use document.querySelector and [element].style to modify HTML elements using JavaScript

Students will perform basic color changes with JavaScript using document.querySelector and [element].style, and copy their successful code into their answer document


## Day 5

MAYBE USE: https://www.thinkful.com/blog/learn-javascript-fast-by-hacking-your-favorite-websites/

The worksheet will give instructions, with examples, of how to use JavaScript functions to select an HTML element from a web page and store it in a variable, which can then be modified using JavaScript to change the appearance of the HTML element on the page.

Students will complete worksheet activities which involve using the console to do the following on the course page with JavaScript:
* Change the background color of the entire page
* Change the color of Figgy's collar
* Turn the <main> element upside-down

Students will write and test their code for these tasks in the console, and copy their successful code into their response document.
