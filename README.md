# Web Development Enrichment Week

Students will learn what the basic languages of the internet are (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), what they do, and how to use them.

Built as a remotely-delivered one-week series of lessons for 8th graders.

## Day 1

### Objectives
* Students will know what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are, and how they work together to build a website.
* Students will know the purpose of HTML. Students will be able to define and give examples of HTML tags, attributes, and elements.
* Students will be able to open the Inspector and navigate to the Elements tab in Chrome.

### Methods
Students will view a video, respond to comprehension questions, and find examples of HTML elements and attributes 'in the wild.'

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will set expectations for work to complete, confirm that students have received all materials, and demonstrate using the Inspector in a browser.

Teacher will set expectations for communication, including when and how to contact the teacher, and when work is due.

#### Part II: Individual
Students will watch this video: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript Explained] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)

Students will answer the following comprehension questions:
* What do the letters HTML stand for?
* What does HTML do on a website?
* What does CSS stand for?
* What does CSS do on a website?

Students will complete the worksheet for Lesson 1, including activities using the inspector on the course site. Questions & tasks on the worksheet include:
* Opening the inspector
* Identifying HTML tags, attributes, and elements
* Demonstrating mastery of HTML vocab by answering questions such as: "Which tag has a class attribute of 'app'?" and "What tag is used in the element that contains the image of Ms. Lord?"

## Day 2

### Objectives
* Students will understand the difference between id and class attributes in HTML.
* Students will know the purpose of CSS. Students will be able to define and give examples of CSS selectors and declarations.
* Students will be able to write CSS selectors that target HTML elements by tag name, id, and class

### Methods
With the teacher, students will explore CSS declarations in the "Styles" section of the "Elements" tab in the Inspector. Students will view a video about how CSS works, and write their own CSS selectors and rules to change presentation of parts of the course page.

### Lesson
#### Part I: Group
Teacher will review how to open Inspector and Navigate through HTML elements in "Elements" tab. Teacher will check that students understand the parts of an HTML element: The tag name, the attributes and their values, and the element itself.

Teacher will show how to find CSS rules for a selected HTML element in the "Styles" section of the "Elements" tab in the Inspector. Teacher will use existing CSS rules to explain the three types of CSS selector:

1. Tag selector
2. Class selector
3. ID selector

Teacher will briefly touch on the idea of specificity.

Teacher will use the following selectors, built into the class site, to demonstrate how to write CSS rulesets (selector, property, and value) in the "Styles" section:

Selectors on Mr. OD:
* ID's: shirt, pants
* Classes: shoe, eye--mr-od

Selectors on Figgy:
* ID: collar
* Class: eye--figgy

Selectors on both:
* Class: eye

Teacher will encourage students to try a few rules on their own and share their screens with the class to view results.

Teacher will end with a reminder to complete the entire worksheet independently, and to reach out with questions.

#### Part II: Individual
Students will watch this video, which recaps the selector rules discussed in group time: [CSS Selectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N97h59hr4pc)

Students will then complete the worksheet for the day, which asks them to combine their HTML and CSS knowledge to answer questions about an example page, and to write CSS rules that would change specified visual elements of the class page.
